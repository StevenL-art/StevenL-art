- 👋 Hi, I’m @StevenL-art
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino code for stepper motors using the TMC 2208 driver
- 🌱 I’m currently learning very basic Arduino
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making a kinetic sculpture. I have the mechanicals done but haven't a clue on the code and am willing to hire someone.
